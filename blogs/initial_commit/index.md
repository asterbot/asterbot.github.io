# Intro
Hi! Welcome to my website and this blog! Good to have you here :D

I'm starting this blogging part of my website and I thought it would be cool to make it like a git graph (which you will probably see properly as I add more blogs). The main idea is that each blog is a commit, and each git branch can represent different "topics" I can write blogs about. Not entirely sure how the last part will work yet, but I'll figure it out. 

You may think this is an overkill to write blogs, and I completely agree, but it was fun to work on lol.


Also I can render markdown, with stuff like 
```cpp
code_blocks()
```
and math equations with LaTEX!
```math
\dfrac{10}{y+2^z}
```

so I can talk about some of the stuff I want to. 

# What will I put in these blogs?
Honestly, anything I want to talk about. Some potential topic categories include:
- A cool piece of CS/Math I wanna share
- Something funny/interesting in the tech world
- A project I'm working on/worked on and what all I learned
- Some coursework I am doing and what I'm learning from it

Or anything else I decide to blog about :D but it will probably be one of these
